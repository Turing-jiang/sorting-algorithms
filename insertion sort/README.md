# Insertion Sort  
Insertion sort an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm.   
Here, a sub-list is maintained which is always sorted.     
The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-list.    
This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2),    
where n is the number of items.
